* Data for the heatmap

** First run:

For all phrases in the Lunyu files 1 to 20, 
  - remove punctuation
  - if phrase is at least 4 characters,
  - look them up in the index:
    - we will use the first three characters to collect lines from the index
    - for these lines, we will collect those that have at most one
      character different in the whole phrase, so e.g.
    - collect the locations and print them to the file along with the
      phrase; these are in the files KR1h0004_001 to 020.
  - Tabulate them for total count and by section in =phrases-heatmap.tab=
  - Tabulate by text in =phrases-net.tab=

** Second run: 4gram
We now build ngrams of length 4 from the text (=ngram-4-list.tab=),
but keep also the number of the phrase from the first run, so that we
can compare and connect.
  - The raw result is in ngram-4-results.tab
